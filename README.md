This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Neural Visualizer
## Description
Neural Visualizer (NeuV.Ai) will use the ability of Deep Learning to synthesize realistic images based on semantic restrictions. Users will be able to define desired images using features or objects and semantic maps. Additionally, users will be able to specify features of the image such as the time of the day and the atmosphere.

## Project Story
Sometimes, the struggle that a creative mind faces is the inability to project or materialize the vision that is inside their heads. The creative minds that we are referring to in this case specifically are people that can visualize images that are as clear as day. The problem comes when they are given tools to project those images on to a physical platform. Those tools might be as novel as a canvas and a paintbrush or as modern as a photoshop software. What we set out to do is remove the barrier between the conception of the image and the actualization of the image on to the physical realm. This will be done by removing the intermediate layer of the process.
